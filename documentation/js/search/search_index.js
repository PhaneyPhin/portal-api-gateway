docker-compose up -d \n## run install\n$ npm install\n## run fresh migration\n$ npm run migrate:fresh\n\n## Run start\n$ npm run start:dev\n\n# production mode\n$ npm run start:prodRun tests\nExample

Documentation\nThe BaseCrudService provides a reusable and extensible structure for implementing CRUD services in a NestJS application. It includes methods for pagination, filtering, and query building. Developers can extend this class to implement specific functionality for their services.\n\nFeatures\n\nPagination: Built-in support for paginated results.\nFiltering: Dynamic filters based on query parameters.\nSearch: Configurable search logic across multiple fields.\nExtensibility: Abstract methods and properties to override in derived classes.\n\n\nUsage\n1. Extend the BaseCrudService\nTo create a specific service (e.g., UsersService), extend the BaseCrudService and implement the required abstract methods.\nExample :import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { BaseCrudService } from './base-crud.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class UsersService extends BaseCrudService {\n  protected queryName = 'u';\n  protected FILTER_FIELDS = ['createdBy', 'expiredAt'];\n  protected SEARCH_FIELDS = ['username', 'email'];\n\n  protected getFilters() {\n    const filters = {\n      expiredAt: (query, value) => {\n        const [start, end] = value.split(',');\n        return query.andWhere('u.created_at BETWEEN :start AND :end', { start, end });\n      },\n      createdBy: (query, value) => {\n        return query.andWhere('u.created_by = :createdBy', { createdBy: value });\n      },\n    };\n\n    return filters;\n  }\n\n  protected getListQuery() {\n    return this.usersRepository.createQueryBuilder(this.queryName);\n  }\n\n  protected getMapperResponseEntityFields() {\n    return (entity) => ({\n      id: entity.id,\n      username: entity.username,\n      email: entity.email,\n    });\n  }\n}\nMethods and Properties\nAbstract Methods\ngetFilters()\n\nPurpose: To define custom filters for querying the database.\nExample:\n\nExample :protected getFilters() {\n  const filters = {\n    expiredAt: (query, value) => {\n      const [start, end] = value.split(',');\n      return query.andWhere('u.created_at BETWEEN :start AND :end', { start, end });\n    },\n    createdBy: (query, value) => {\n      return query.andWhere('u.created_by = :createdBy', { createdBy: value });\n    },\n  };\n  return filters;\n}\ngetListQuery()\n\nPurpose: To define the base query for fetching data.\nExample:\n\nExample :protected getListQuery() {\n  return this.usersRepository.createQueryBuilder('u');\n}\ngetMapperResponseEntityFields()\n\nPurpose: To map database entities to response DTOs.\nExample:\n\nExample :protected getMapperResponseEntityFields() {\n  return (entity) => ({\n    id: entity.id,\n    username: entity.username,\n    email: entity.email,\n  });\n}\nProtected Properties\nqueryName\n\nType: string\nPurpose: Alias for the query (e.g., 'u' for users).\n\nFILTER_FIELDS\n\nType: string[]\nPurpose: List of fields for direct filtering.\n\nSEARCH_FIELDS\n\nType: string[]\nPurpose: List of fields for search functionality.\n\n\nPublic Methods\nlist(pagination: PaginationRequest): Promise>\n\nPurpose: Retrieves a paginated list of entities with filters applied.\nParameters:\npagination: Contains pagination, filter, and search parameters.\n\n\nReturns: A paginated response DTO.\nExample:\n\nExample :const pagination: PaginationRequest = {\n  skip: 0,\n  limit: 10,\n  order: { 'u.created_at': 'DESC' },\n  params: { createdBy: 'admin-id' },\n};\n\nconst result = await this.list(pagination);\nUtility Methods\ngetAllFilters()\n\nPurpose: Dynamically generates filters for fields and search logic.\nExample:\n\nExample :protected getAllFilters() {\n  const filters = this.getFilters();\n\n  if (this.FILTER_FIELDS) {\n    this.FILTER_FIELDS.forEach((field) => {\n      filters[field] = (query, value) =>\n        query.andWhere(`${this.queryName}.${field} ILIKE :${field}`, {\n          [field]: `%${value}%`,\n        });\n    });\n  }\n\n  if (this.SEARCH_FIELDS && this.SEARCH_FIELDS.length > 0) {\n    filters['search'] = (query, searchValue) => {\n      const searchConditions = this.SEARCH_FIELDS.map(\n        (field) => `${this.queryName}.${field} ILIKE :search`,\n      ).join(' OR ');\n\n      query.andWhere(`(${searchConditions})`, { search: `%${searchValue}%` });\n    };\n  }\n\n  return filters;\n}applyQueryFilters(query, params)\n\nPurpose: Applies filters to a query based on parameters.\nParameters:\nquery: The TypeORM query builder.\nparams: The filter parameters.\n\n\nExample:\n\nExample :protected applyQueryFilters(query, params) {\n  const filters = this.getAllFilters();\n\n  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(params)) {\n    if (value && filters && filters[key]) {\n      filters[key](query, value);\n    }\n  }\n}\nExample Use Case\nTo implement a service for managing users with filtering and pagination:\nExample :@Injectable()\nexport class UsersService extends BaseCrudService {\n  protected queryName = 'u';\n  protected FILTER_FIELDS = ['username', 'email'];\n  protected SEARCH_FIELDS = ['username', 'name', 'email'];\n\n  protected getFilters() {\n    return {\n      username: (query, value) =>\n        query.andWhere('u.username ILIKE :username', { username: `%${value}%` }),\n      email: (query, value) =>\n        query.andWhere('u.email ILIKE :email', { email: `%${value}%` }),\n    };\n  }\n\n  protected getListQuery() {\n    return this.usersRepository.createQueryBuilder(this.queryName);\n  }\n\n  protected getMapperResponseEntityFields() {\n    return (entity) => ({\n      id: entity.id,\n      username: entity.username,\n      email: entity.email,\n    });\n  }\n}Deployment\nWhen you're ready to deploy
